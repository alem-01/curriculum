## JavaScript introduction

Welcome to the JS Express Course!


JS is a dynamically developing programming language. It is used to develop 
web and mobile applications.

## Syntax

The syntax of the programming language is quite intuitive, our arsenal includes 
basic types and many built-in features to work with them. There are many 
debuggers, programs that let you find errors.

## Development

You can use `repl.it` editor for development. 

JS is built into your browser and you can easily run the code by opening `Developer Tools` (you can google it).
There is also an engine [node] (https://nodejs.org) that can execute JS code.

You have to accept the invitation to assignment before starting to do the exercises.
